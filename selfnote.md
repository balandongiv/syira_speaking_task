To calculate the differential entropy of a continuous distribution sample in Python, you can utilize the `differential_entropy` function from the `scipy.stats` module. This function offers several estimation methods, including 'vasicek', 'van es', 'ebrahimi', 'correa', and an automatic selection mode. By default, the method is chosen based on the sample size.

Here's an example demonstrating its usage:


```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import differential_entropy

# Generate a sample from a standard normal distribution
rng = np.random.default_rng()
sample = rng.standard_normal(1000)

# Calculate the differential entropy
entropy = differential_entropy(sample)
print(f"Differential Entropy: {entropy}")
```


In this example:

- We import the necessary modules.
- We generate a sample of 1000 data points from a standard normal distribution using NumPy's random number generator.
- We compute the differential entropy of the sample using `differential_entropy` and print the result.

The `differential_entropy` function also allows customization through parameters such as `window_length` (for the Vasicek estimator), `base` (to specify the logarithm base), `axis` (to determine the axis along which to compute the entropy), and `method` (to select the estimation method). For detailed information on these parameters and the available methods, refer to the [SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.differential_entropy.html).

Approximate Entropy (ApEn) is a statistical measure used to quantify the regularity and unpredictability of fluctuations in time-series data. It was introduced to analyze complex systems and is particularly useful in fields like physiology for assessing system complexity. citeturn0search1

In Python, several libraries offer functions to compute Approximate Entropy:

1. **EntropyHub**: A comprehensive library providing various entropy and complexity metrics for time-series analysis. It includes the `ApEn` function to compute Approximate Entropy. citeturn0search9

   **Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install EntropyHub
   ```


**Usage**:
   ```python
   import EntropyHub as EH
   import numpy as np

   # Example time-series data
   data = np.random.rand(100)

   # Compute Approximate Entropy
   ApEn, Phi = EH.ApEn(data, m=2, tau=1, r=0.2*np.std(data))
   print(f"Approximate Entropy: {ApEn}")
   ```


In this example:
- `m` is the embedding dimension.
- `tau` is the time delay.
- `r` is the tolerance (typically 0.2 times the standard deviation of the data).

2. **AntroPy**: A Python package offering time-efficient algorithms for computing the complexity of time-series, including Approximate Entropy. citeturn0search0

   **Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install antropy
   ```


**Usage**:
   ```python
   import antropy as ant
   import numpy as np

   # Example time-series data
   data = np.random.rand(100)

   # Compute Approximate Entropy
   ApEn = ant.app_entropy(data, order=2, metric='chebyshev')
   print(f"Approximate Entropy: {ApEn}")
   ```


In this example:
- `order` corresponds to the embedding dimension `m`.
- `metric` specifies the distance metric used; 'chebyshev' is commonly used for ApEn.

3. **Custom Implementation**: For educational purposes or specific requirements, you might implement Approximate Entropy from scratch. Here's a simple example:

   ```python
   import numpy as np

   def phi(m, data, r):
       N = len(data)
       x = np.array([data[i:i + m] for i in range(N - m + 1)])
       C = np.sum(np.max(np.abs(x[:, None] - x[None, :]), axis=2) <= r, axis=0) / (N - m + 1)
       return np.sum(np.log(C)) / (N - m + 1)

   def approximate_entropy(data, m, r):
       return abs(phi(m, data, r) - phi(m + 1, data, r))

   # Example time-series data
   data = np.random.rand(100)

   # Parameters
   m = 2  # Embedding dimension
   r = 0.2 * np.std(data)  # Tolerance

   # Compute Approximate Entropy
   ApEn = approximate_entropy(data, m, r)
   print(f"Approximate Entropy: {ApEn}")
   ```


In this implementation:
- `phi` computes the correlation sum for embedding dimension `m`.
- `approximate_entropy` calculates the difference in `phi` values for dimensions `m` and `m+1`.

When choosing a method or library, consider the specific requirements of your analysis, such as computational efficiency, ease of use, and the ability to handle your data's characteristics.
